        "summary": "Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) enables precise, non-invasive brain therapy but is hindered by complex skull-induced wave distortions. Traditional numerical simulations are accurate but computationally intensive, limiting clinical scalability. To address this, we introduce TFUScapes, a large-scale, anatomically realistic simulation dataset, and DeepTFUS, a transducer-aware deep learning model for fast 3D pressure prediction. Our approach combines physics-based modeling with neural networks to achieve high-fidelity results with significant speedups, supporting scalable and personalized tFUS planning.",
